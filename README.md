# WindowsStringCounter
Powershell script to find and count matches for a string in any given folder. 
In Stardew, there is an issue where when mods cause major lag when they make changes everytime "ontimechanged" is called. 
This is not a fix, but it is a script aimed at finding and counting all occurences of "ontimechange" to identify mods that may be a major culprit in performance issues. 
However anyone can with a Windows machine can use this for their own purposes by editing the $searchPattern variable.

Works best on Powershell 5.1

Use by moving or copying strFinder.ps1 to folder you want to check and run with powershell.
